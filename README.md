Financial Management Application
1.	What is the problem?

The problem our project is designed to address is a lack of financial capability in the population of a number of different countries in the World and this lack is challenged with the ongoing increase use of crypto currencies. Our initial focus will be on individual early adopters of these types of digital currencies.

2.	What is the solution?

The solution we are proposing is to develop a financial management application (App). The App will enable individuals to learn how to track their income and expenses and manage their assets, completely integrated to crypto currency technologies.  The App will have the capabilities to use, exchange and manage digital financial instruments such as cash, transfers, checks, vouchers, invoices, and invoice payments and other related services between peers. 

3.  Value Proposition

The App will be built on four principles. It will be:
•	Simple
•	Interactive
•	Adaptable
•	Secure

Our review of PFM (Personal Financial Management) tools indicates that most of the Apps available on the market today require linking the App to bank account and credit card information to take advantage of all the functionalities of the App. This is possible for the many financially-included people in the developed world, but not possible for the financially-excluded in the developing world.  A different approach is needed, one that first empowers people to manage their money effectively and then gives them the option to link to a Financial Service Provider (FSP) and/or use diverse Crypto currencies with its financial instruments naturally embedded in the App.
The intent will be to provide users with a simple App that builds their financial capabilities through intuitive, interactive steps that build on each other. Furthermore, the App will enable individual users to form peer groups of users who can interact to help each other make the best use of the functionalities and content of the App as well as to share money management tips. The connectivity will also enable users to compare their money management practices with those of other similar people. Through these three mechanisms, the App will enable users to gain the confidence to manage their money.
The App will be adaptable in that it will so that it can be scale-adjusted to a number of different markets and populations around the world. With this in mind, this app will be developed and tested the App within several countries, based on market research and human-centered design and rapid proto-type testing principles.
It will be used strong cryptographic techniques to create secure financial instruments and transactions.
This process extensively will be documented, identifying the most effective ways in which there was a lesson learned from what features of the App worked or did not work.   

3.	How we will know if the project is successful? How will we measure it?  If this project is involved in direct service, how many people will be reached? How many will be financially included? 

We will evaluate the project using three major metrics:
A.	What was the uptake and use of the App?
B.	Did the App result in behavior change?
C.	Did at least one FSP connect its product and service offerings to the App?
Evaluation of the project under criterion A. above will enable us to evaluate whether people found the App useful. Our long-term goal will be to have 50,000 active users, meaning they use the App at least twice a month, with 5,000 active users at the end of two years.
The App will be designed to empower people to change their financial behavior – create and follow a budget, increase savings, or lower their debt burden to manageable levels. It is these types of behavior change that we will focus on under our evaluation criterion B..
The App will sync each users’ data to the cloud (with their permission) and we will be able to monitor how they are using the App and whether that usage pattern changes over time. These data will enable us tell whether they use their budget, including updating it, whether they save, and whether they pay down, or take on new debts.
Criterion C. is specifically designed to evaluate whether there is a business case to support the continued development and deployment of the App around the world.
If an FSP were to enter into a contract with Paradigma to gain access to the App for the purposes of offering financial services to the App users, they would have to pay to do so, and they would pay to maintain and develop the interface. It is through such payments that the initial support for the program is expected to translate into a long-term, self-sustaining initiative that will connect financially excluded individuals to FSPs, while also ensuring that the App remains available to anyone with the adequate device (whose numbers will only increase over time globally).

4.	What is the biggest risk/barrier/potential failure point in this project? 

The biggest risk to this project is technical obsolescence. It may be the case that a new technology on a new platform emerges during the life of the project that makes the App obsolescent.
It also may be the case that another organization develops an App that captures the attention of users before we can do so.
