The solution we are proposing is to develop a financial management application (App). The App will enable individuals to learn how to track their income and expenses and manage their assets, completely integrated to crypto currency technologies.  The App will have the capabilities to use, exchange and manage digital financial instruments such as cash, transfers, checks, vouchers, invoices, and invoice payments and other related services between peers.
